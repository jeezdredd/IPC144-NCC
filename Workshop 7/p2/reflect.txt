1. I guess the only advantage of using user-defined data types program will be easier
to understand, maintain and debug. Also, the code size in program takes less space. And it can contain different 
data types in one structure.

for example: 
struct playerinfo 
	{
		int totallives;
        int totaltreasures;
        int pastpositions[maxlength]; 
        int treasobt;
		char player;
        char trail[maxlength]; 
	};

  (it contains data about player lives, amount of treasures in total, all positions that player had and etc)



2. We need to create new structure, like presented above with the data of the past games. Logically, after the game ends
in 3 cases - blown up by bomb, obtained treasure, ran out of moves program should store all data in this new structure and save it, 
so player can call this variable and get data.

3. Making table with the moves,bombs and treasures in the lass part of W7P2. Mostly I was trying to make output suit the pdf
document. Other things, like making loops was pretty easy, because I just re-made the w7p1 loops
so they would suit the new workshop.
