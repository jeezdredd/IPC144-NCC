1. I learned how to use and establish secure SSH and SFTP connection using PuTTY and WinSCP on Windows OS. Although, I learned how to use Microsoft Visual Studio
and how to create and manage projects.
2. SSH is basically a secure protocol which allows user to connect securely to any computer in unsecured network. I used SSH in PuTTY,
to submit and manage files through the Command Line.
3. SFTP - secured protocol to transfer files over the web. I used SFTP in WinSCP to upload files onto the Seneca College Matrix.
